------------------

- Added missing minimum version declaration for `zope.app.authentication`,
  namely 3.8.


3.6.0 (2010-09-25)
------------------

- LP: #161906: Remove superfluous "helpful" message. Improve wording of of the
  relation between roles and permissions in the manage_permissionform.

- Moved the following views to `zope.app.authentication` to inverse
  dependency between these two packages, as `zope.app.securitypolicy` is
  deprecated in ZTK 1.0 (leaving BBB imports in place):

  - ``@@grant.html``
  - ``@@AllRolePermissions.html``
  - ``@@RolePermissions.html``
  - ``@@RolesWithPermission.html``

3.4.6 (2007-11-09)
